Question 1

Write a program that takes some data as string input. Then it tries to find a positive number x such that 
 when x is appended to the end of the string, the SHA256 hash of this new string is less than the target, which is
 0x00000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
 Also print the time it takes to get this nonce value. 
 
 Answer : 
 
 In my code first I declare the target value as a string variable and then convert it to int type variable to compare it with the subsequent values.
 Then we run a loop and keepon adding numbers to the end of the input string until the hash value generated by the SHA256 function comes less than the target value.
 When such a value is found we break the loop and report the value and the time taken to find it.
 
 For example : 
                Input String : dhwanitbalwani
                Now the output hash value in hexadecimal form must contain atleast 5 zeroes in the start after adding different numbers to the string.
                Output for this string :
                
                Target value : 0x00000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
                Time taken to find the value : 0.8860507011413574 seconds
                The required number x to add to the string is : 197374
                The string after adding the value : dhwanitbalwani197374
                The equivalent hexadicamal value of the required string = 00000d5a582cd02c9a4816ebe961a84bc21b290baf22fc18549703bff77a8f3e
