
My assignment works well in Remix IDE. 

First we deploy the "MetaCoin" and "Loans" contract using a single user address. Then we can change the user and perform the functions "reqloan", "getOwnerBalance" to request the owner of the contract to return the money he owes him and to check how much money he has right now. Then we can revert to the original address with which we made the contract to perform the functions "view_Dues" and "settleDues" to check how much the owner is due and to settle the amount due.

Note: If we run the functions "view_Dues" and "settleDues" with an address other than that of the contract owner then we will face an error.
